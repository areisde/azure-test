Levels L2 and L3 – which set rigorous standards designed for organisations facing the highest levels of cyber risk – will become available at the end of July.\\nThe assessment process for DCC certification will include a point-in-time assessment against UK defence standards, compliance with which is soon to become a requirement in all defence procurement and contract activities. This assessment will enable organisations to demonstrate a “clear, future-focused” approach to cyber resilience that they can then submit in satisfaction of MoD contract requirements, and use as a means to demonstrate their expertise to other potential customers.\\nWhen it comes to future procurement exercises, the MoD will assign a required level for suppliers working on different contracts – however, businesses interested in bidding will not be limited in the certification level for which they apply. Indeed, they can apply for certification at any level they wish, even if they are not currently working on any MoD business.\\nThe scheme’s backers said they hoped this level of flexibility would enable organisations to better demonstrate their commitment to ongoing resilience, prepare for future opportunities in advance, and avoid the need to go through repeat assessments over and over.\\nRead more about supply chain security\\nRecent updates from software supply chain security vendors simply take over vulnerability management on behalf of IT orgs,\\nrather than provide facilitating tools\\n.\\nMany businesses around the world are taking the decision to alter their supplier mix in the face of tariff uncertainty, but in doing so are creating more cyber risks for themselves,\\naccording to a report\\n.\\nThree software supply chain security vendors join the AI agent trend that is sweeping tech, as AI-generated code\\nthreatens to overwhelm human security pros\\n.\\nThe programme also aligns with wider cyber best practice, with all levels requiring organisations to already hold the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC’s)\\nCyber Essentials\\nbadge – levels two and three will require Cyber Essentials Plus certification once they are launched.\\n“We are thrilled to collaborate with the Ministry of Defence on the Defence Cyber Certification scheme and very grateful to the cyber security experts who have been so generous with their time to help us develop the scheme,” said IASME chief executive Emma Philpott.\\nHannah Clarke-Dabson, principal consultant at CNI cyber specialist Bridewell, who was involved in creating the guidance for the DCC scheme, added: “Bridewell is excited to continue supporting the evolution of the DCC scheme as it gains traction across the defence supply chain.\\n“From the outset, we have been working closely with IASME, defence suppliers and key stakeholders from across the industry to help shape the future of the DCC scheme and ensure that we, as a DCC Certification Body, are actively supporting and guiding organisations through the certification process,” she said.\\nOrganisations interested in participating are encouraged to visit the scheme’s homepage, hosted by IASME,\\nto learn more\\n.', published_at='Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:26:00 GMT', url='', source='computerweekly', created_at='', importance_score=0.3744460135347539),\n",

According to the report, data analytics can be deployed to make sure the right amount of money goes to the right recipient and to find potentially incorrect transactions.\\nThe report covers basic tools that check if payment to a supplier is not duplicated, to the use of emerging technology like artificial intelligence (AI) to identify risky transactions. “With good-quality linked data, these technologies can deliver more immediate returns on investment, tackling fraud and error without requiring the wider system or organisational reform that fuller digital transformation would require,” the NAO said.\\nThe report highlights\\npoor data sharing\\nand poor adoption of data sources, which can be used to help tackle fraud. The NAO noted that there has not been widespread take-up of central initiatives, such as the National Fraud Initiative, which compiles data to identify potentially fraudulent activity. The NAO was told that among the reasons for low adoption were a lack of understanding of such initiatives among officials and the cost.\\nIn addition, the NAO found that counter-fraud teams are not always aware of datasets that might help them tackle fraud and error. While the government is trying to improve the quality of some key datasets that have the potential to unlock better fraud and error analytics in future, the NAO reported that inconsistent data formats and systems make it harder to use data to tackle fraud and error.\\nIt recommended that HM Treasury make use of the National Fraud Initiative mandatory and agree with the Public Sector Fraud Authority (PSFA) the criteria for where public bodies should use other centrally provided tools. The NAO said HM Treasury and the PSFA should also review the charging model for PSFA central services to ensure they do not dissuade public bodies from making savings.\\nThe report’s authors noted that public bodies continue to find it difficult and bureaucratic to share data to help tackle fraud, even though it is permitted under legislation. But they warned that greater data sharing could lead to fraud being exploited across departments.\\n“As more data is shared and systems linked, the risk increases that fraudsters penetrate one system to take advantage of another,” they warned in the report.\\nThe NAO said the PSFA and the Government Digital Service (GDS) should build on the Digital Economy Act 2017 data-sharing process to introduce a managed process to support public bodies to share data. They should also advise public bodies on how to ensure clear ongoing governance arrangements over shared data to manage the risk of fraudsters gaining access to multiple systems through access to one. It also urged the PSFA to consider using non-government and private sector databases, such as the fraud databases produced by Cifas.\\nAlthough the GDS\\nBlueprint for modern digital government\\nsets out a vision for\\ngovernment digital transformation\\n, which covers the use of data analytics to tackle fraud and error, the NAO said it has not provided an implementation plan or considered that plan from the perspective of fraud and error data analytics.\\nRead more NAO report stories\\nUK government cyber resilience\\nweak in face of mounting threats: The National Audit Office has found UK government cyber resilience wanting, weakened by legacy IT and skills shortages, and facing mounting threats.\\nPublic sector IT projects –\\nstupendous incompetence\\nor bad luck?

       " Article(id='https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366627196/July-Patch-Tuesday-brings-over-130-new-flaws-to-address', title='July Patch Tuesday brings over 130 new flaws to address', body='Microsoft has patched a total of 130 new common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) across its product suite in\\nits monthly Patch Tuesday update\\n, including 10 critically dangerous flaws, many of them in Microsoft Office, while a bunch of third-party issues bring the monthly total to approximately 140. However, despite its wide breadth, Redmond’s latest update is light on\\nzero-day\\nissues.\\nIndeed, the top-line vulnerability – and the only one that comes close to being classified as a zero-day – is tracked as CVE-2025-49719. It is an information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server arising from improper input validation, enabling an unauthorised attacker to disclose information – specifically uninitialised memory – over the network.\\nCredited to Microsoft’s own Vladimir Aleksic, CVE-2025-49719 is considered relatively trivial to exploit, and although Microsoft has no evidence that it is being exploited in the wild, it has already been publicly disclosed, so attacks will likely begin imminently. CVE-2025-49719 carries a CVSS score of 7.5 and is ranked as being of important severity.\\nMike Walters, president and co-founder of patch management specialist\\nAction1\\n, outlined a number of advanced attack scenarios in which CVE-2025-49719 could come into play.\\n“An attacker could map out database structures, identify injection points, and gather information to support more targeted intrusions,” he said. “[Or] by accessing uninitialised memory, they might recover fragments of authentication credentials, potentially enabling further attacks against the database or related systems.\\nWalters added: “The risk increases when combined with other techniques – for example, using the leaked data to refine SQL injection, bypass authentication, or move laterally using connection strings that contain credentials to other systems.\\n“The potential impact on organisations is significant, as any user of Microsoft SQL Server could be affected, covering a large portion of the enterprise database market.”\\nWalters said that the data exposure risk made CVE-2025-49719 a high-priority concern for defenders at any organisation holding valuable or regulated data. He added that the comprehensive nature of the affected versions – which span multiple releases dating back nine years – may indicate a more “fundamental issue” in how SQL Server handles memory management and input validation.\\nThe 10 critical vulnerabilities, in CVE number order, are as follows:\\nCVE-2025-47980\\n– an information disclosure vulnerability in Windows Imaging Component\\nCVE-2025-47981\\n–\\nan RCE vulnerability in SPNEGO Extended Negotiation Security Mechanism\\nCVE-2025-48822\\n– an RCE vulnerability in Windows Hyper-V Discrete Device Assignment (DDA)\\nCVE-2025-49695\\n– a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft Office\\nCVE-2025-49696\\n– a second RCE flaw in Microsoft Office\\nCVE-2025-49697\\n– a third RCE flaw in Microsoft Office\\nCVE-2025-49702\\n– a fourth and final RCE flaw the same product suite\\nCVE-2025-49704\\n– an RCE issue in Microsoft SharePoint\\nCVE-2025-49717\\n– an RCE flaw in Microsoft SQL Server\\nCVE-2025-49735\\n– an RCE vulnerability in Windows KDC Proxy Service (KPSSVC)\\nThe July Patch Tuesday drop also lists two critical third-party RCE vulnerabilities in AMD processors, to which security teams should pay close attention.\\nNone of the 12 above-listed issues are currently known to be being exploited, nor have exploits yet been made available. However, CVE-2025-47981 in SPNEGO – an important protocol that is used to negotiate authentication on critical services, many of them internet-facing – caught the eye of the\\nQualys Threat Research Unit’s\\n(TRU’s) senior manager of security research, Saeed Abbasi, who warned that this particular patch should be applied immediately.\\n“A single unauthenticated NEGOEX packet can drop attacker-controlled code straight into Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), running as SYSTEM. No clicks, no creds needed – exactly the recipe that turns bugs into network worms. This isn’t just a bug – it’s a loaded gun pointed at your organisation,” he said.\\n“Once inside, the exploit can pivot to every Windows 10 endpoint that still has the default PKU2U setting enabled. We expect NEGOEX exploits to be weaponised within days, so attacks are imminent.\\n“Patch within 48 hours, start with internet-facing or VPN-reachable assets and anything that touches AD. If you absolutely can’t patch, disable ‘Allow PKU2U authentication requests’ via GPO and block inbound 135/445/5985 at the edge,” he said.\\nWatchTowr\\nfounder and CEO Ben Harris agreed this was one to watch. He said: “Remote code execution is bad, but early analysis is suggesting that this vulnerability may be wormable – the sort of vulnerability that could be leveraged in self-propagating malware and make many revisit trauma from\\nthe WannaCry incident\\n, and similar.\\n“Microsoft is clear on pre-requisites here: no authentication required, just network access. We shouldn’t fool ourselves – if the private industry has noticed this vulnerability, it is certainly already on the radar of every attacker with an ounce of malice. Defenders need to drop everything, patch rapidly, and hunt down exposed systems.”\\nNotLogon – the vulnerability found by an AI\\nFinally this month, Dor Segal, senior security researcher at Silverfort, highlighted\\nCVE-2025-47978\\n, which his team identified in the Windows Netlogon protocol using an artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (LLM) to scan and compare old release notes as part of a test to see whether or not AI could help speed up the vulnerability discovery process.\\nThe Silverfort team has dubbed this issue NotLogon\\n– although note that Microsoft’s disclosure refers to it as affecting the closely related Windows Kerberos protocol.\\nAlthough not critical in its severity, CVE-2025-47978 enables an attacker using a domain-joined machine with minimal privileges to send a specially crafted authentication request that will have the effect of crashing a domain controller and causing the system to fully reboot.\\nSuch a crash impacts the core Windows LSASS security process and disrupts Active Directory services such as user logins, policy application and access to authentication-dependent resources.\\nSegal said the issue was a great example of how even low-privilege computers with basic network access can still be the harbinger of bigger problems.\\n“This vulnerability shows how only a valid machine account and a crafted RPC message can bring down a domain controller – the backbone of Active Directory operations like authentication, authorisation, policy enforcement and more,” he said.\\n“If multiple domain controllers are affected, it can bring business to a halt. NOTLogon is a reminder that new protocol features – especially in privileged authentication services – can become attack surfaces overnight. Staying secure isn’t only about applying patches – it’s about examining the foundational systems we rely on every day.\\n“I strongly suggest installing the latest Microsoft Patch Tuesday update immediately across all domain controllers, along with tightening access controls for service and machine accounts,” he concluded.\\nRead more about Patch Tuesday\\nJune 2025: Barely 70 vulnerabilities make the cut for Microsoft’s monthly security update, but an RCE flaw in WEBDAV and an EoP issue in Windows SMB Client still\\nwarrant close attention\\n.\\nMay 2025: Microsoft fixes five exploited, and two publicly disclosed, zero-days\\nin the fifth Patch Tuesday update of 2025\\n.\\nApril 2025: Microsoft is correcting 124 vulnerabilities in its April Patch Tuesday, one of which is being actively exploited in the wild,\\nand 11 of which are ‘critical’\\n.\\nMarch 2025: The third Patch Tuesday of 2025 brought\\nfixes for 57 flaws and a hefty number of zero-days\\n.\\nFebruary 2025: Microsoft corrected 57 vulnerabilities,\\ntwo of which are being actively exploited in the wild, and three of which are ‘critical’\\n.\\nJanuary 2025: The\\nlargest Patch Tuesday of the 2020s so far\\nbrings fixes for more than 150 CVEs ranging widely in their scope and severity – including eight zero-day flaws.\\nDecember 2024: Microsoft has fixed over 70 CVEs in its\\nfinal Patch Tuesday update of the year\\n, and defenders should prioritise a zero-day in the Common Log File System Driver, and another impactful flaw\\nin the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\\n.\\nNovember 2024: High-profile vulns in NTLM, Windows Task Scheduler, Active Directory Certificate Services and Microsoft Exchange Server\\nshould be prioritised from November’s Patch Tuesday update\\n.\\nOctober 2024: Stand-out vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s latest Patch Tuesday drop include problems in Microsoft Management Console\\nand the Windows MSHTML Platform\\n.\\nSeptember 2024: Four critical remote code execution bugs in Windows and three critical elevated privileges vulnerabilities\\nwill keep admins busy\\n.\\nAugust 2024: Microsoft patches six actively exploited zero-days among over 100 issues\\nduring its regular monthly update\\n.\\nJuly 2024: Microsoft has fixed almost 140 vulnerabilities in its latest monthly update, with a Hyper-V zero-day\\nsingled out for urgent attention\\n.', published_at='Tue, 08 Jul 2025 18:20:00 GMT', url='', source='computerweekly', created_at='', importance_score=0.4938764865461556),\n",
       " Article(id='https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366627274/MS-calls-for-mandatory-ransomware-reporting', title='M&S calls for mandatory ransomware reporting', body='Marks & Spencer chairman Archie Norman has described the recent\\nransomware attack\\non the retailer’s systems as something akin to an “out-of-body experience” as he called for cyber attack victims to be brave, bite the bullet, and be\\nopen and transparent about their experiences\\n.\\nSpeaking before the Business and Trade Sub-Committee on Economic Security, Arms and Export Controls –\\nin a session\\nat which representatives from\\nfellow attack victim Co-op Group\\nand various cyber experts including former National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) chief\\nCiaran Martin\\nalso gave evidence – Norman said that while he did not believe government can regulate its way to security, there was a role for it to play in making sure learnings from security incidents are discussed and dispersed, particularly at boardroom level.\\nHe said M&S wanted to use its experience for the benefit of government and other businesses. “I’ve already got one or two boards that have invited me to come and see them and share our war stories, which I will certainly do,” he said.\\n“We do think that mandatory reporting is a very interesting idea,” added Norman. “It’s apparent to us that quite a large number of cyber attacks never get reported to the NCSC. In fact, we have reason to believe there have been two major cyber attacks on large British companies in the last four months which have gone unreported.\\n“We think that’s a big deficit in our knowledge as to what’s happening,” he said. “I don’t think it would be regulatory overkill to say if you have a material attack … for companies of a certain size, you are required within a time limit to report those to the NCSC, and that would enhance the central intelligence body around this.\\nNorman said that early on – before reports of a cyber attack hit the front pages – M&S had shared all the information it had about the ongoing incident with the NCSC so it could alert other retail businesses, likely including Co-op Group.\\nHe also revealed that M&S had received an undisclosed level of support from the US FBI, saying it was “more muscled up” in this regard.\\nTraumatic incident\\nDiscussing the impact of the cyber attack, Norman said: “It’s fair to say that everybody at M&S experienced it. Our ordinary shop colleagues [were] working in ways they hadn’t worked for 30 years, working extra hours just to try to keep the show on the road. Let aside our tech colleagues, for a week, probably, the cyber team had no sleep … It’s not an overstatement to describe it as traumatic.\\nM&S is still rebuilding its business and expects to be doing so for some time to come, and recognising that its overall IT estate is a hodgepodge of legacy systems, Norman said the organisation is now moving up various phases of an ongoing tech refresh in the wake of the attack.\\nCommenting on remarks made in the House of Commons by MP David Davis that an unnamed British company had paid a significant ransom recently, Norman declined to say whether or not M&S was the organisation to which Davis was referring, and would not directly disclose whether or not the retailer had received a ransomware demand.\\nHe said that early on, M&S had taken a decision not to communicate directly with its attackers, leaving that to cyber professionals.\\nNorman added that for some time, M&S did not know who had attacked it. “\\nThey never send you a letter signed Scattered Spider\\n– that doesn’t happen,” he said. “We didn’t even hear from the threat actor for approximately a week after they penetrated our systems. You rely completely upon your security advisors to say what they think is happening, and they recognised the threat actor by the attack vector.\\n“Also, they communicate through the media, and in this case their chosen avenue of communication\\nwas principally the BBC\\n. It was sometimes an unusual experience to be brushing your teeth in the morning when somebody comes onto the BBC with a communication from the people who are allegedly attacking your business.”\\nSocial engineering\\nTaking further questions from the panel, Norman went out of his way to explicitly deny media reports that suggested M&S had “left the back door open”, saying the attack had occurred via social engineering via an undisclosed third-party, as has been extensively speculated over the past few weeks.\\n“The attack on M&S has been penned as sophisticated impersonation, in this case likely referring to the use of advanced social engineering tactics, potentially including deepfake audio or video, to convincingly pose as executives or trusted insiders,” said Richard LaTulip, field chief information security officer at threat intelligence specialist\\nRecorded Future\\n.\\n“Protecting against sophisticated impersonation attacks requires a layered approach,” he added. “While technical defences, such as multi-factor authentication and identity verification tools, are essential, the human layer remains the most vulnerable. That’s why ongoing training and executive-level awareness are critical. Employees, especially those in high-risk roles, must be educated to recognise social engineering tactics, including AI-generated deepfakes or urgent messages impersonating leadership.”\\nTimeline: Scattered Spider attacks in 2025\\n22 April 2025:\\nA cyber attack at M&S has caused significant disruption to customers, leaving them unable to make contactless payments\\nor use click-and-collect services\\n.\\n24 April:\\nM&S is still unable to provide contactless payment or click-and-collect services amid a cyber attack that it says has forced it to move a number of processes offline\\nto safeguard its customers, staff and business\\n.\\n25 April:\\nM&S shuts down online sales as it works to contain and mitigate\\na severe cyber attack on its systems\\n.\\n29 April:\\nThe infamous Scattered Spider hacking collective may have been behind the ongoing cyber attack on M&S that has crippled systems at the retailer and\\nleft its ecommerce operation in disarray\\n.\\n30 April:\\nA developing cyber incident at Co-op has forced the retailer to pull the plug on some of its IT systems as it works\\nto contain the attack\\n.\\n1 May:\\nCo-op tells staff to stop using their VPNs and be wary that their communications channels may be being monitored, as a cyber attack on the organisation\\ncontinues to develop\\n.\\n1 May:\\nHarrods confirms it is the latest UK retailer to experience a cyber attack, shutting off a number of systems in an attempt\\nto lessen the impact\\n.\\n2 May:\\nThe National Cyber Security Centre confirms it is providing assistance to M&S, Co-op and Harrods as\\nconcerns grow among UK retailers\\n.\\n7 May:\\nNo end is yet in sight for UK retailers subjected to apparent\\nransomware attacks\\n.\\n13 May:\\nM&S is instructing all of its customers to change their account passwords after a significant amount of data was stolen\\nin a DragonForce ransomware attack\\n.\\n14 May:\\nGoogle’s threat intel analysts are aware of a number of in-progress cyber attacks against US retailers linked to the same Scattered Spider gang\\nthat supposedly attacked M&S and Co-op in the UK\\n.\\n20 May:\\nCold chain services provider Peter Green Chilled, which supplies the likes of Aldi, Sainsbury’s and Tesco, has been forced to halt operations\\nafter succumbing to a ransomware attack\\n.\\n11 June:\\nSo-called Black Swan events expose the blind spots in even the most sophisticated forecasting models, signaling a need to rethink how businesses, and those investing in them, quantify\\nand prepare for cyber risk\\n.\\n13 June:\\nThe recent spate of cyber attacks on UK retailers has to be a wake-up call to build more cyber resilience into digital supply chains and\\nfortify against social engineering attacks\\n.\\n17 June:\\nFollowing a series of high-profile attacks on prominent retailers and consumer brands, the Scattered Spider cyber crime collective appears to be\\nexpanding its targeting to the insurance sector\\n.\\n20 June:\\nThe UK’s Cyber Monitoring Centre has published its first in-depth assessment of a major incident, reflecting on the impact of and lessons learned from\\nScattered Spider attacks on M&S and Co-op\\n.\\n27 June:\\nMultiple reports are emerging of cyber attacks on airlines – Google Cloud’s Mandiant\\nbelieves them to be linked\\n.\\n2 July:\\nAustralian flag carrier Qantas is investigating significant data theft of personal information for up to 6 million customers after a third-party platform\\nused by its call centre was compromised\\n.\\n2 July:\\nA developing cyber attack at Australian airline Qantas that started at a third-party call centre is already being tentatively attributed to Scattered Spider.\\nFind out more and learn about the next steps for those affected\\n.', published_at='Tue, 08 Jul 2025 14:36:00 GMT', url='', source='computerweekly', created_at='', importance_score=0.2725209833931893),\n",

       " Article(id='https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/From-the-FBI-to-FA-lessons-learnt-in-safeguarding-systems-and-data', title='From the FBI to F&A: lessons learnt in safeguarding systems and data', body=\"One might not typically expect a childhood on a Texas farm to lead to a career that involve investigating cybercriminals at the FBI, and then to one protecting financial data at a global software company. But cybersecurity is an industry built on unpredictability – and that’s exactly what draws many aspiring individuals, including myself many years ago, to it.\\nHaving a varied and diversified career has many benefits, and not least the ability to approach challenges with a broader lens, draw on a wide range of experiences, and adapt quickly to new and evolving threats. In cybersecurity, where no two days are the same, this kind of versatility is invaluable. From early roles with Department of the Navy and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court – to the FBI – there are many learnings I have since taken into security roles in telecoms, consumer goods, private equity, and now in the financial software space as CISO at BlackLine. While some of these industries and organisations couldn’t be more different, there are some core skills and lessons for any security professional to be aware of.\\nFinance teams: the unexpected front line\\nWhen most people think about\\ncyber security\\n, they picture IT departments and firewalls. But increasingly, attackers are bypassing the technical perimeter and going straight for the people who hold the purse strings.\\nFinance and accountancy (F&A) professionals handle sensitive data, authorise payments, and interact with vendors: all prime opportunities for cybercriminals looking to manipulate systems or people. In fact, business email compromise (BEC), fake invoice scams, and internal fraud schemes often originate within finance teams, whether due to process gaps, social engineering, or a simple lack of cyber awareness. Yet, many finance teams still see cybersecurity as “someone else’s job.”\\nSimilar issues persist in many other industries, with those in front-line roles vulnerable to attack. This is a dangerous blind spot. With global financial fraud losses topping $500 billion annually, finance, and other key department, leaders must now think of cyber risk as a core business risk – one that requires proactive controls, training, and collaboration with security teams.\\nSecuring operations: from mindset shift to practical steps\\nThe first step is recognising that cybersecurity isn’t only a technical issue; it’s a business issue. Therefore, all teams have a vital role to play in keeping the organisation safe and running effectively.\\nAt BlackLine, we treat F&A professionals as key players in our security programme. We invest heavily in tailored security awareness training, including phishing simulations, and ensure our financial controls are designed with cybersecurity in mind. Dual approvals for payments, multi-factor authentication for system access, and regular audits of user permissions are standard practice.\\nToo often, a cyber-attack or fraud happens because of outdated processes or excessive trust in a single individual. Building layered controls – including in all financial processes – and pressure-testing them regularly, can drastically reduce risk.\\nEqually important is recognising third-party exposure. For example, finance and accounting teams often deal directly with vendors, payment processors, and banks – any of which can introduce vulnerabilities. As a result, due diligence, regular risk assessments, and clear escalation paths for when suspected issues and threats arise are essential components of a secure financial operation. Crucially, other departments would be wise to take similar steps to prevent potential third-party security issues arising.\\nWhy communication is a CISO’s strongest tool\\nOne of the most valuable skills I’ve developed over the years isn’t technical, it’s translation. Communicating cybersecurity risk in business terms is key to engaging stakeholders who don’t live and breathe threat landscapes.\\nDuring my time at BT, I learned how to\\nframe security in the language of risk\\n: not just cyber risk, but financial, operational, and reputational risk. That shift in perspective has allowed me to build stronger alignment between IT and business functions, especially in highly regulated industries like finance.\\nBeing transparent about both successes and challenges is also critical. I set clear expectations with my team and the board about what we measure, why it matters, and where we need to improve. This builds trust and helps foster a culture where continuous improvement – not fear – drives action.\\nThe rise of AI – and the risks that come with it\\nOf course, the cybersecurity landscape is always evolving. Right now, the integration of generative and\\nagentic AI\\nv tools is reshaping how all departments, including security teams, operate. These technologies offer incredible promise in automating tasks and detecting anomalies, but they also introduce new risks, from data leakage into public LLMs to inaccuracies that could undermine integrity, including in a financial sense.\\nIt’s therefore vital that new AI solutions are not viewed as a silver bullet. They must be deployed carefully, with clear usage policies, regular reviews, and strong governance to prevent new threat types from gaining a foothold.\\nAt our company, we’re investing in AI capabilities that complement – rather than replace – human oversight. And we’re ensuring that all employees, not just technologists, are trained to understand both the opportunities and limitations of these tools.\\nCyber resilience in a borderless world\\nCyber threats no longer respect geographic boundaries. While compliance requirements may vary by region, attackers don’t care whether your headquarters is in London, Los Angeles or Lagos. That’s why I advocate for setting a global “high bar” for security controls, rather than customising by country.\\nTaking finance professionals specifically, whether you're a global CFO or an accountant at a mid-sized firm, the fundamentals remain the same: confidentiality, integrity, and availability – otherwise known as the CIA triad – must be preserved at all costs. And in the age of AI, that becomes even more complex.\\nAdvice for the next generation\\nTo those considering a career in cybersecurity, my advice is this: your perspective matters. My journey has taken unexpected turns, from tracking down hackers to building board-level security strategies.

The agency warned of the likelihood of more distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and even ransomware attacks run in collaboration with other groups.\\nWill Robert ‘hack-and-leak’?\\nCISA’s warnings came as a hacking operation backed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – known as Robert – threatened to release compromising information on the administration of president Donald Trump in retaliation for the airstrikes.\\nThe group, which previously leaked emails in the run up to last year’s presidential election in the US, claimed to have over 100GB of data to “share”.\\nSpeaking to the\\nReuters\\nagency\\nin the past few days, Robert claimed some of these emails were taken from the accounts of Trump adviser Roger Stone, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles,\\nand Stormy Daniels\\n, the adult entertainer at the centre of a hush-money scandal.\\nMax Lesser, senior analyst on emerging threats at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ (FDD’)\\nCenter on Cyber and Technology Innovation\\n, said that it was wise to be cautious about the credibility of Robert’s claims.\\nHe explained: “A common technique in state-sponsored data leaks is to sneak lies into troves of largely true information. The authenticity of the majority of the data makes the fabrications appear real. This information, when it comes out, must be verified before [it is] believed.”\\nLesser said hack-and-leak ops were a popular tool for such state-linked actors because they enable states that lack a military advantage to be seen to retaliate without crossing a threshold that might lead to a kinetic response from the US.\\n“Considerable conversation about Iran’s retaliation in cyber space to US military strikes has focused on cyber attacks against companies and critical infrastructure. But cyber-enabled influence operations provide another plausible vector of attack. This was not the first hack-and-leak conducted by Iran against Trump, and likely not the last,” he added.\\nLesser also warned that in disabling some of the US government’s capabilities around countering foreign influence operations it had enhanced the ability of groups like Robert to damage national and global security.\\n“The Trump administration…should consider revitalising counter-malign influence efforts while ensuring these efforts safeguard free speech,” he said.\\nRead more about Iranian threat actors\\nBad actors have used AI technology for more than a decade to spread misinformation and disinformation. However, the tools are getting more sophisticated\\nand difficult to detect\\n.\\nCISA, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence attributed a recent hack-and-leak\\nattack on Trump's 2024 election campaign to Iran\\n.\\nNation-state threat actors like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are targeting critical infrastructure and sensitive data, so executives must\\nprepare to defend against them\\n.\", published_at='Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:39:00 GMT', url='', source='computerweekly', created_at='', importance_score=0.47248898249225235)]"
